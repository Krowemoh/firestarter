# Firestarter

This is an express project starter. This is specifically for me :)

This application uses the following global packages:

    - nodemon - code watcher and runner
    - pm2 - process manager 

I install the following packages for the project:

    - dotenv - environment variables
    - helmet - adds secure headers in production
    - hpp - stops queries from being arrays
    - method-override - adds support for put, patch and delete
